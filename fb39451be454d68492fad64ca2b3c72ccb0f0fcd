So either that assertion is redundant (it\u0027s already elsewhere or should be elsewhere), or it may actually break something. In either case, I don\u0027t think it should be here.",

This can occur when bit \u003d\u003d 1 \u0026\u0026 probability \u003d\u003d 256 or when bit \u003d\u003d 0 and probability \u003d\u003d 0.\n\nThis assert only runs when you are trying to measure and debug the total entropy and it seemed like a nonsensical probability would be something useful to know.",
