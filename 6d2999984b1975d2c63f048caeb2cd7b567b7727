      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nThis patch correctly initializes \u0027max_mv_magnitude\u0027 of frame_parallel_level 2 frame(s) in a given parallel encode set with that of frame_parallel_level 1 frame during av1_init_parallel_frame_context(). In the parent version, the init was happening only for the last frame_parallel_level 2 frame in a parallel encode set, causing issues when 3 or 4 parallel frames are present in a parallel encode set. With the fix in this patch, the initialization is now proper for any number of parallel frames.\n\nThis patch also cleans up the copy of \u0027max_mv_magnitude\u0027 present in AV1_PRIMARY and its related code by doing the update of max_mv_magnitude of a parallel_cpi in av1_init_parallel_frame_context().\n\nThis change is bit-exact and has been locally verified with bitstream match tests over a combination of various configuration values for --threads, --tile-rows, --tile-columns, --cpu-used, --end-usage, --row-mt, etc.\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
