      "message": "I agree that the nominal range is bd+1.\nThe intent here should be to derive a bound based on the restrictions already defined in the spec, not to add a new restriction.\nWith noise and given the restrictions/clamping that we have expressed in the spec, bd+2 sounds right for the DCT, except for the 8-bit case where I think it should be 12 (\u003dbd+4).\nThe last step of the inverse ADST inverts the sign of values. A 16-bit value such as -32768 might thus become a 17-bit value (32768). The range may thus have to be increased by 1 bit for the ADST case.\nFinally in the case of the column inverse identity transform a value may be multiplied by 4 before being shifted down by 4 bits. The range may thus be even higher: bd+4 in general and 14 for the 8-bit case.\nTo the best of my understanding the derived bound at the output of the inverse transform should be AOMMAX(bd+4, 14)",

A signed 16-bit value such as 32767 could yield a signed 15-bit value 8192 after a multiplication by 4 and a round-shift(4) operation (note that the max range for signed 14-bit is -8192..8191).\nThe bound may thus have to be increased to AOMMAX(bd+5, 15)",
