      "message": "Hi Marco, Yunqing, \n\nIn this CL, we adjust MV precision for relatively static (e.g. background) large blocks with low spatial complexity. This is enabled for speed 7, 8 HDRES only. We have renamed the existing sf: “force_half_pel_block” to “reduce_mv_pel_precision” to facilitate integration with function subpel_select() in nonrd_pickmode.c. \n\nThe following worst-case contents are visually tested:\nSpeed 7: mj1vc720p (600 kbps, 800 kbps), vidyo1 (800 kbps)\nSpeed 8: mj1vc720p (600 kbps, 800 kbps) \nThere are no noticeable differences as compared with the ref.\n\nWe have used a threshold to label a block has very low SAD. To do this, we have added an array element source_sad_nonrd[2]. If this is OK, that is already in the patchset. Alternatively, we can introduce and use a new level “kVerylowSad” in the existing enum table. However, this will need changes at several places to ensure bit-exactness. If you prefer that, we can do this in a separate CL.\n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nThanks,\nNeeraj",
