      "message": "Hi Marco, Yunqing, \n\nIn this CL, we adjust MV precision for relatively static (e.g. background) large blocks with low spatial complexity. This is enabled for speed 7, 8 HDRES only. We have renamed the existing sf: “force_half_pel_block” to “reduce_mv_pel_precision” to facilitate integration with function subpel_select() in nonrd_pickmode.c. \n\nThe following worst-case contents are visually tested:\nSpeed 7: mj1vc720p (600 kbps, 800 kbps), vidyo1 (800 kbps)\nSpeed 8: mj1vc720p (600 kbps, 800 kbps) \nThere are no noticeable differences as compared with the ref.\n\nWe have used a threshold to label a block has very low SAD. To do this, we have added an array element source_sad_nonrd[2]. If this is OK, that is already in the patchset. Alternatively, we can introduce and use a new level “kVerylowSad” in the existing enum table. However, this will need changes at several places to ensure bit-exactness. If you prefer that, we can do this in a separate CL.\n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nThanks,\nNeeraj",

In addition to specific responses to comments, we have another recent observation. \n\nTests indicated that we can employ both algos for some speeds. We can separate them into two separate sfs.

We can study that.\n\nYes, subpel is probably better for noise removal at somewhat higher SAD (e.g. 3-5 per-pixel) or to predict better if the block has details. For this algo, we tuned a lower kLowSad level (1.5 per-pixel) than the existing kLowSad (5 per-pixel). These blocks are relatively homogeneous (low source-var). In addition, for blocks with lower QP, subpel may still help, as there is a better chance of details being preserved post-quantization. Thus, (qband !\u003d 0) helped bring down worst-case drops.",
