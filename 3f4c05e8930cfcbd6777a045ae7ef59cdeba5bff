      "message": "Hi Marco, Yunqing, \n\nIn this CL, we adjust MV precision for relatively static (e.g. background) large blocks with low spatial complexity. This is enabled for speed 7, 8 HDRES only. We have renamed the existing sf: “force_half_pel_block” to “reduce_mv_pel_precision” to facilitate integration with function subpel_select() in nonrd_pickmode.c. \n\nThe following worst-case contents are visually tested:\nSpeed 7: mj1vc720p (600 kbps, 800 kbps), vidyo1 (800 kbps)\nSpeed 8: mj1vc720p (600 kbps, 800 kbps) \nThere are no noticeable differences as compared with the ref.\n\nWe have used a threshold to label a block has very low SAD. To do this, we have added an array element source_sad_nonrd[2]. If this is OK, that is already in the patchset. Alternatively, we can introduce and use a new level “kVerylowSad” in the existing enum table. However, this will need changes at several places to ensure bit-exactness. If you prefer that, we can do this in a separate CL.\n\nPlease review the CL.\n\nThanks,\nNeeraj",

In addition to specific responses to comments, we have another recent observation. \n\nTests indicated that we can employ both algos for some speeds. We can separate them into two separate sfs. For example, the existing logic can be enabled for speeds 8, 9, 10, whereas the new logic can be enabled for speeds 7, 8, 9. If we have the new logic on top of existing, we can get the following results already (without any tuning):\n```\ncpu Test set    Instr cnt     BD-Rate Loss (%)       trade   max-qty  max-drop-content\n                 Red (%) avg.psnr  ovr.psnr   ssim   -off     -drop   \n8    rtc         2.202    0.3904    0.3809   0.4481  0.1773   1.0272  mj1vc720p\n8    rtc_derf    1.383    0.1483    0.1715   0.1574  0.1073   0.9673  street180p\n9    rtc         1.811    0.4158    0.3704   0.3759  0.2295   1.7233  vidyo1_1280x720_60\n9    rtc_derf    1.588    0.5162    0.5427   0.3911  0.325    2.2115  desktopqvga2_320_240\n```\nHere, the action item will be to reduce quality impact in terms of all: avg psnr, ssim and importantly, visual tests.\n\nWe plan to study this in detail \u0026 get back in the next couple of days.

I am not sure of the visual impact of reduce_mv_pel_precision \u003d\u003d 2. We can study that.\n\nYes, subpel is probably better for noise removal at somewhat higher SAD (e.g. 3-5 per-pixel) or to predict better if the block has details. For this algo, we tuned a lower kLowSad level (1.5 per-pixel) than the existing kLowSad (5 per-pixel). These blocks are relatively homogeneous (low source-var). In addition, for blocks with lower QP, subpel may still help, as there is a better chance of details being preserved post-quantization. Thus, (qband !\u003d 0) helped bring down worst-case drops.",
