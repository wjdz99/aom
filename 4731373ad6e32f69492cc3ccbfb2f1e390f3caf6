      "message": "Hi Wan-Teh,\n\nAs per our study, mv cdfs are not updated and mv costs are not consumed during the encode for intra frames. Hence, we added a condition to skip the calculation of mv costs in av1_set_cost_upd_freq()/skip_mv_cost_update().\n\nWe validated the current patch for video and still-image encode. Specifically, we configured libaom in ALLINTRA mode (in libavif) for AVIF encode.\n\nIt was verified that output of AVIF/video encode is bit-exact with parent version.\n\nInstruction count reduction observed for AVIF still image encode is given below:\n\n           Instruction Count\n  speed      Reduction(%)  \n    0           0.231\n    1           0.441\n    2           0.576\n    3           0.956\n    4           1.467\n    5           1.603\n    6           4.443\n\nInstruction count reduction observed for all-intra video encode is given below. The speed-up is relatively higher in this case due to low-res/mid-res contents (as high as ~20%) as superblock size is 64x64 for speed\u003d6. Hence savings per pixel seems to be more for these resolutions.\n\n           Instruction Count\ncpu-used      Reduction(%)  \n    6           10.377\n\nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command:\n\n $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./avifenc ...\n\nPlease review.\n\nRegards,\nJayasanker.",
