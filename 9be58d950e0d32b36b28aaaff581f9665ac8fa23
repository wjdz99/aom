      "message": "Hi Chi Yo, Yunqing, \n\nThe function intra_rd_variance_factor() is used to calculate a multiplication factor to be applied on the RD value to improve perceived sharpness. This module calculates the sum of log(1+var4x4/16) across all 4x4 blocks. This CL uses logarithm product rule to reduce the log() computations in this module. \n\nWe validated this patch for allintra video and still-image encode. Following are instruction count/encode time reduction results when AVIF encode was tested for a typical image dataset.\n\nFor AVIF still-image encode with tune\u003dpsnr,\n\n            Instruction Count\n              / Encode Time      BD-Rate Loss(%)      \n       speed    Reduction(%)     psnr      ssim    \n         0         2.076        -0.2833   -0.3711\n         1         2.481        -0.1683   -0.2831\n         2         2.329        -0.0881   -0.2117\n         3         2.372        -0.0839   -0.2781\n         4         2.310         0.0000    0.0000\n         5         2.732         0.0000    0.0000\n         6         2.586         0.0000    0.0000\n         7         3.178         0.0000    0.0000\n         8         1.240         0.0000    0.0000\n         9         0.000         0.0000    0.0000\n\nFor AVIF still-image encode with tune\u003dssim,       \n              Instruction Count\n                / Encode Time    BD-Rate Loss(%)      \n       speed    Reduction(%)     psnr      ssim  \n         0         2.271        -0.3666   -0.4165\n         1         2.621        -0.2236   -0.3091\n         2         2.462        -0.0965   -0.2214\n         3         2.547        -0.0892   -0.2821\n         4         2.410         0.0000    0.0000\n         5         2.824         0.0000    0.0000\n         6         2.614         0.0000    0.0000\n         7         3.095         0.0000    0.0000\n         8         1.283         0.0000    0.0000\n         9         0.000         0.0000    0.0000\n\nIn the above data, instruction count reduction is quoted for speed \u003c6 and encode-time reduction is quoted for speed \u003e\u003d6.
