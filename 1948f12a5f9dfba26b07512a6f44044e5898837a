      "message": "Here are my thoughts regarding this CL. Please correct me if I am wrong.\nLooks like you are trying not to call av1_update_ref_frame_map() after encoding a frame, so this makes FP possible.\nMaybe we can achieve FP without this modification. For example, we encode frame 1, 3, 6 in parallel after encoding frame 2. Since 1 and 3 won\u0027t be used as reference frames, we don\u0027t need to update ref frame after their encoding (i.e. don\u0027t need to call av1_update_ref_frame_map()?) So, frame 1, 3, 6 use the same set of stacks (lst_stack/gld_stack/arf_stack) that are updated after frame 2 is done. There shouldn\u0027t be any dependency related to these stack update. Can this work?\n",

      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nYes, the reference pictures remain the same for frames 1, 3 and 6 when 1 and 3 are non-references. However, the state of the stacks (lst_stack/gld_stack/arf_stack) change across the three frames due to the presence of in-between show-existing frames (2 after 1 making 2 to move from arf_stack to lst_stack, 4 after 3 making 4 to move from arf_stack to lst_stack), due to which the mapping of reference pictures to reference frame slots change across these 3 frames. This makes the encode of 3 and 6 dependent on the state of the stack of the previous frames. Hence, we feel that using stack based approach may not work seamlessly for FP1.\nPlease let us know your opinion.\n\nRegards,\nRemya",
