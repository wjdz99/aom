The correct reason is that \"\u003e\u003e 1\" truncates the quotient whenever the strength is odd.\n\nPerhaps the comment meant to say that the 0.5 discarded by \"\u003e\u003e 1\" is a significant part of the strength when the strength is small, so if there are few strength levels, half of the strengths (the odd strengths) are reduced significantly more than a half.",
