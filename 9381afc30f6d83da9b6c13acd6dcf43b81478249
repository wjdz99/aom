Spending more bits for a worse metrics outcome on static content seems silly. Re the non screen content part of the reason for this change was a non screen clip where there was a large spike (which this cuts by half) and the non screen content which is not static does not suffer the undershoot in the same way. Here it is just a trade off of fewer big spikes for a small metrics hit.",
