      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\nThis patch disables 8x4 and 4x8 rectangular partitions at very low quantizers. We have extended SF prune_rectangular_split_based_on_qidx to speed 4 (and 5).  We also considered using the SF rect_partition_eval_thresh to achieve the same. As the SF rect_partition_eval_thresh uses frame level q index and prune_rectangular_split_based_on_qidx uses block level q index, we chose prune_rectangular_split_based_on_qidx.\n\nPlease find below detailed borg result :\nCPU Resolution Instruction Count           BD-Rate Loss %\n                 Reduction %      avg.psnr ovr.psnr     ssim\n 4   LOW RES       2.588          0.1209     0.1148     0.0638\n 4   MID RES       0.426          0.0021     0.0006     0.0074\n 4   HD RES        1.471          0.0511     0.0397     0.0292\n 4   AVERAGE       1.777          0.0648     0.0585     0.0367 \n\nIn the commit message, BD rate impact column: \n[+] sign is for BD-Rate drop \n[-] sign is for BD-Rate improvement \nThe instruction count reduction specified has been measured using command: $ perf stat -e instructions:u ./aomenc …\n\nThe changes are bit-exact for all other speed levels with no impact on speed. Although we have enabled the SF for speed 5, the changes are bit exact , as all the sub 8x8 partitions are already pruned in speed 5 using prune_sub_8x8_partition_level SF.\n\nPlease review the patch.\nRegards,\nAkshata\n",
