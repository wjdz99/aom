It looks this data structure is used many places, as well as its member variables (e.g., stats_in), not sure whether they could be removed as well for further cleanup? If answer is yes, maybe we can remove it later in future if it is not needed anymore, seems lots of code changes being involved. Thanks for this code patch.",
