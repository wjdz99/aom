      "message": "Hi Yunqing,\n\nAs discussed, the logic is simplified by moving out set_mv_search_params() from av1_set_frame_size(). Now av1_set_mv_search_params() is called at the appropriate places when needed.\n\nBitmatch has been verified with patchset 2 for presets 1 to 6. The change is verified to be bit-exact with the parent version for real-time encoding.\n\nPlease review the patch.\n\nThanks,\nNithya",
