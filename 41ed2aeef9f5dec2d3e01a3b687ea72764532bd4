It caps the amount of change (no overshoot) and ensures the low-pass effect.  I did try to divide by 32 first (and also try other weights summing up to 32), but the code as it is now worked much better.  I wrote a script to try a few hundred combinations in AWCY and from the best group with internal differences within the noise range I picked what looked most like the original two-pass.\n\n(Clipping here is part of the original generalised CLPF (also presented at IETF95), so it\u0027s not a new idea)",

IIRC I discussed this with JM (when it was only two-pass) who preferred the freedom of choice on the encoder side and to make things orthogonal (perhaps it can add 0.1% - 0.2% gains at the cost of adding a dimension to the search space), and I favoured a single value but didn\u0027t have a strong opinion.  For two-pass it was only one bit, now it\u0027s two (and the same for pri and sec), so it may be worth revisiting.  I don\u0027t have a strong opinion.
