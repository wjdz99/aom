      "message": "Hi Marco, Yunqing,\n\nIn this CL, we avoided the code related to signaling motion mode by populating features-\u003eswitchable_motion_mode appropriately. After this change, the motion mode is inferred as SIMPLE_TRANSLATION when warp and OBMC tools are disabled. Hence the call to av1_count_overlappable_neighbors() function is avoided. This CL also seems to help in speed-up of the bit-stream preparation stage as motion mode is not signaled/modeled (during entropy coding) and inferred to be SIMPLE_TRANSLATION. \n\nPlease check the borg results for rtc and rtc-screen test-sets below.\n \n```\n                   \tInstruction Count            BD-Rate Loss(%)\n    cpu Resolution   \t   Reduction(%)    \tavg.psnr   ovr.psnr    ssim\n     7         rtc      \t0.251         \t0.0073     0.0061   -0.0386\n     7    rtc_derf      \t0.323         \t0.0341     0.0289    0.0290\n     7  rtc_screen      \t0.146          -0.0253    -0.0208    0.0603\n     8         rtc     \t\t0.310          -0.0733    -0.0693   -0.0154\n     8    rtc_derf      \t0.418         \t0.1480     0.1469    0.1906\n     8  rtc_screen      \t0.028          -0.7676    -0.1882   -0.3181\n     9         rtc     \t\t0.287         \t0.0795     0.0564    0.0400\n     9    rtc_derf              0.339         \t0.0226     0.0127    0.0457\n     9  rtc_screen     \t\t0.311          -0.1215     0.0792    0.1363\n    10         rtc      \t0.263          -0.0532    -0.1052   -0.1043\n    10    rtc_derf      \t0.271          -0.1469    -0.1696   -0.2264\n    10  rtc_screen      \t0.148          -0.2022    -0.3691   -0.2984\n```\n\nPlease check the maximum BD-Rate impact cases below(for Avg.

Hence there seem to be BD-Rate savings overall.\n\nWe see that call to av1_count_overlappable_neighbors() can be avoided from set_params_rd_pick_inter_mode() and av1_rd_pick_inter_mode_sb_seg_skip() as well. We shall explore and plan the same in a separate CL.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts on the CL.\n\nRegards,\nRanjit\n",

      "message": "We analyzed the BD-Rate loss for jimred_320_240 content and found that loss is primarily contributed by the behavior at 100 kbps. Please find the relevant data below \nParent version            100.3kbps - 36.07db\nModified version        100.2kbps - 35.74db\nWhen we analyzed the above case, we found that the content has one static frame every 5 frames. It looks like content is obtained via frame rate conversion (through replication) from 20fps to 25fps. \nThe static frames seem to be quite sensitive to quantizer fluctuations,  segment mapping which made bit consumption, rate correction factors quite different in parent and modified versions after coding static frames. \nWe did a quick 20 fps encoding test (by skipping static frames) and observed that parent and modified versions produce close output as given below. \nParent version (20 fps)            100.2kbps - 35.80db\nModified version (20 fps)        100.2kbps - 35.96db\nHence we feel that the static frames could have caused the above behavior due to rate control modeling (rate correction factors).",
