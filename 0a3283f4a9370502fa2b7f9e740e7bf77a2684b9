      "message": "Julio: Based on Note 2, we should be able to add +1 to the sec strength 3 and remove the entire Note 2, right?\n\nI.e., if we add +1 to the sec strength 3, we don\u0027t really need a comment, because we are following the AV1 spec faithfully. (Well, the reader needs to see that the reduced sec strength is never 3 or 4, so it can be packed with the pri strength without further processing.)",

      "message": "Well, we have flexibility when it comes to defining what \"reduced strength CDEF\" means in code, as we set the rules of the derivation. As long as reduced strength values are smaller than the original values we\u0027ll be producing valid CDEF values for both packing and bitstream signaling purposes, while also being true to the concept of \"reducing strength\".\n\nTo follow up on your example: defining sec strengths of 3 (actually 4) as reduced 1 (i.e. by not adding +1) is as valid as defining them as reduced 2 (i.e. by adding +1). This is because both 1 and 2 both fall within the valid sec strength range. Not adding +1 is more compact in code, so that\u0027s why I went that way.\n\nDoes this answer your question, Wan-Teh? Maybe I misunderstood something.",
