      "message": "Sorry for reviewing late. I was busy on resolving the enc/dec mismatch.\nDo we really need a bit to enable/disable intraBC?  Comparing enabling it by default when \"allow_screen_content_tools\" is on, the bit actually allows disabling intrabc. May I know the benefit of disabling it?  how about allow it always on when \"screen tools is allowed\"?",

      "message": "Current scheme is to support intrabc when screen tools are allowed. This flag signals if intrabc is actually ever used in current frame. For example, the case can be: we consider intrabc during encoding, but it\u0027s never selected as the final mode. We can use this flag to decide if in-loop filters should be disabled: https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/31902. We shouldn\u0027t disable in-loop filters when screen tools are allowed but intrabc is not used, e.g. only palette is used.",

      "message": "Seems that this bit is for coding efficiency: we can enable loop filters when intraBC is not helpful. I am afraid that we cannot find such content (Color Palette is helpful but intraBC is not). It will be an image in discrete colors, but not spacially predictable, even with 4x4 prediction unit. I guess this bit always has same value as \"allow_screen_tools\".\nI do not have strong objection to this bit. We can keep it here. But please review it later to make syntax cleaner.",
